Python Interpreter: Python 3.5.1 (Will not work in version 2)


When the program starts, it will prompt the user for inputs 1 - 7:
1. Problem 1: (A^B) - (C^D)
2. Problem 2: (A^B) / (C^D)
3. Problem 3: 1 + ½ + ⅓ + … + 1/N
4. Test 1: A + B (will work with negative numbers)
5. Test 2: TwosComp (will work with positive or negative numbers)
6. Test 3: A / B (for testing division)
7. Exit


* Exponent should operate in log(n) operations
* Can compute 999^999 under recursion limit
   * Does take around five minutes to compute though
* Can handle negative input
